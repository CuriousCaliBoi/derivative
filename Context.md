## 3. Key Files & Directories
- `/models/`: Transformer model definitions and utilities
- `/analysis/`: Core Jacobian/Hessian computation modules
- `/viz/`: Visualization and plotting utilities
- `/experiments/`: Experiment scripts and configurations
- `/data/`: Sample datasets for analysis
- `/results/`: Output plots, matrices, and analysis results
- `/notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and demos

## 4. Technical Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Hessian matrices can be very large (nÂ²), consider block-wise computation
- **Numerical Stability**: Use double precision for second-order derivatives
- **Computational Efficiency**: Leverage PyTorch's autograd and consider approximation methods
- **Model Sizes**: Start with small models, scale up gradually
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple inputs to understand variance
